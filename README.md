# Car-Insurance-Claims-Dataset-Using-Tableau

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Car Insurance Claims** dataset to explore various factors impacting insurance claims. As a **Lead Data Analyst**, the goal of this project is to create a **storyboard** that showcases key insights and visualizations from the data. This storyboard will help Senior Management make data-driven decisions to improve the current insurance claims system.

The Tableau dashboard allows for interactive data exploration, with a focus on understanding patterns related to **car ownership, claims frequency, insurance amounts, demographics of drivers, and more**.
